This project is called TinDog.
It's my second project in WebDev and the one I spent the most time upon.
I did it as part of a Web Development Course on Udemy called the 'Complete Web Development Bootcamp' by Angela Yu.
Unfortunately I could only code the HTML and CSS parts before JEE forced me to stop.
